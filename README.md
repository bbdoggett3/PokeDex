This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Functional Pokedex

In this project I wanted to create a web application that can map through an array of Pokemon cards. The main purpose of this project is to see how data is fetched from a client to a server, and how that server sends that data back. This was something I did for fun, and wanted to practice it over the weekend. I hope to continually build on this project to better my skills in React.
